## Outcomes:

1. By Following the Passenger Counter App Demonstratation, I created [Resolved-Tickets-Helper](insert live link).

   Path: [Github Directory](https://github.com/ShadmanSakib22/Perborgen_Learn_JavaScript_Course/tree/main/1.%20Build%20a%20Passenger%20Counter%20App/28.%20Similar%20Project)

   User Story:
   A customer support agency wants its employes to log the number of tickets they resolved in Morning, Afternoon, and Evening session.

   - The employee will click the "Resolved" button everytime he completes a support ticket.
   - Before going on Morning Break, the employee needs to click the "Save" button. Same follows in the Afternoon and Evening session.
   - The data will be displayed on a table. Table columns; Employee ID, Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Total
   - The App will also show the total number of tickets compeleted by all Employees in that day - calculation occurs everytime the Employee hits save.

   Lessons Applied: Variables (let, const), Arrow functions, String literals, String-Number conversions, Basic Math, If-else conditions, Array, DOM manipulation - .addEventListener .querySelector .querySelectorAll .innerHTML .textContent, .forEach.
