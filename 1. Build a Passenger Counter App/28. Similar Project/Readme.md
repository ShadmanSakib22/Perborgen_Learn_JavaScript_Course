## Shadman Sakib Notes:

By Following the Passenger Counter App Demonstratation, I created [Resolved-Tickets-Helper](insert link).

Path: 1. Build a Passenger Counter App/28. Similar Project

# User Story:

A customer support agency wants its employes to log the number of tickets they resolved in Morning, Afternoon, and Evening session.

1. The employee will click the "Resolved" button everytime he completes a support ticket.
2. Before going on Morning Break, the employee needs to click the "Save" button. Same follows in the Afternoon and Evening session.

The data will be displayed on a table. Table columns; Employee ID, Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Total

3. The App will also show the total number of tickets compeleted by all Employees in that day - calculation occurs everytime the Employee hits save.
